*Description*
This package exposes two interactive functions: ~watch-file~ and
~unwatch-file~.  ~watch-file~ places a file watch on the file visited
by the current buffer and reloads the buffer every time a change
occurs.  ~unwatch-file~ removes the file watch placed by ~watch-file~,
returning the buffer to normal.
